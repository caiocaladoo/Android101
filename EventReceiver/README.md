# Orientation Tracker
## Notify the users when your device change its orientation (Landscape or Portrait)

The user can see the rotation of his/her device by the image that it's display into the center of the screen. The image is able to track the user handling of device.

Every new event, for a new orientation, the app will throw a notification for the user telling that device's orientation has changed.
